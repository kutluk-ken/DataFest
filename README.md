### The Challenge
The American Bar Association provides pro bono (i.e. free of charge) legal services across the
United States via an online platform available in some states and territories. The platform
allows people who qualify (based on state-based low-income status) to post legal questions
and receive legal advice from volunteer lawyers. The ABA would like to anticipate the sorts of
legal questions that arise so that they can prepare volunteers to address those questions,
better know how and when to recruit lawyers with specific expertise, and know how to advise
state partners on general trends theyâ€™re seeing. This information will help the ABA and their
volunteer attorneys better adapt to new laws, societal changes, natural disasters, and other
events that may cause an increase (and, in some cases, decrease) in the demand for pro bono
legal services on particular legal topics.

The data contains actual conversations between clients and lawyers (redacted to maintain
confidentiality) and basic demographic information about the client. These exchanges have
been previously classified into categories and sub-categories by the people posting questions;
potentially, specific conversations might be sorted into different categories by platform
administrators.

**Your challenge is to provide advice to the ABA concerning any patterns or trends you see in
these conversations that would help the ABA advise its state partners, create resources to
respond to identified patterns, and devise outreach strategies to better reach potential user
populations and volunteers.** For one example, the ABA would like to help its lawyers better
"connect" with clients, which means they should use similar language to describe issues as
their clients, should understand the cultural, societal and emotional context of the clients'
messages, and should understand how to best listen and engage with clients.

## Goal: 
To provide advice to the American Bar Association (ABA) concerning any patterns of
trends seen in conversations of clients requesting pro bono support. Broadly, helping the ABA
advise its state partners, create resources to respond to identified patterns, and devise outreach
strategies to better reach potential user populations and volunteers.
